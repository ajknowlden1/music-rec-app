    description: `New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980 by vocalist and
          guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen
          Morris. The band formed after the demise of Joy Division, following
          the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian
          Gilbert on keyboards later that year. New Order's integration of
          post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most
          acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. They were the flagship
          band for Manchester-based independent record label Factory Records and
          its nightclub The Ha√ßienda, and they worked in long-term collaboration
          with graphic designer Peter Saville.`,

Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.`,
